    <h6>Hydropower, or hydroelectric power, is one of the oldest and largest sources of renewable energy, which uses the natural flow of moving water to generate electricity. Hydropower currently accounts for 31.5% of total U.S. renewable electricity generation and about 6.3% of total U.S. electricity generation.

        While most people might associate the energy source with the Hoover Dam—a huge facility harnessing the power of an entire river behind its wall—hydropower facilities come in all sizes. Some may be very large, but they can be tiny, too, taking advantage of water flows in municipal water facilities or irrigation ditches. They can even be “damless,” with diversions or run-of-river facilities that channel part of a stream through a powerhouse before the water rejoins the main river. Whatever the method, hydropower is much easier to obtain and more widely used than most people realize. In fact, all but two states (Delaware and Mississippi) use hydropower for electricity, some more than others. For example, in 2020 about 66% of the state of Washington’s electricity came from hydropower. </h6>

          Hydropower facilities range in size from large power plants,
    which supply many consumers with electricity, to small and even ‘micro’ plants,
    which are operated by individuals for 
    their own energy needs or to sell power to utilities.

       <h4 style="color: brown;"><b>Large Hydropower</b></h4>
    
    Although definitions vary, DOE defines large hydropower
    plants as facilities that have 
    a capacity of more than 30 megawatts (MW).
    



    
       <h4 style="color: brown;"><b>Small Hydropower</b></h4>
    
    Although definitions vary, DOE defines small 
    hydropower plants as projects that generate
    between 100 kilowatts and 10 MW.
    
        <h4 style="color: brown;"><b>Micro Hydropower</b></h4>
    
    A micro hydropower plant has a capacity of up to 100 kilowatts. 
    A small or micro hydroelectric power system can 
    produce enough electricity for 
    a single home, farm, ranch, or village.     </div>
